This is a mod for Fabric 1.21 to disconnect you from a Minecraft world or server using a keybind.
You can customize the keybind in the controls settings. 
The main use for the mod is to act as a way to disconnect if your game crashes on logout. It happened to me and a friend so maybe others have the same issue out there.
